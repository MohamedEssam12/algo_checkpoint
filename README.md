# GoMyCode First Algorithm Checkpoint.

## A Counter Project for number of the characters, words and vowel letters inside an entered string by the user.

The project aims to improve the usage of types of the variables in addition to the sequential, selectors and iterative logics in data structure by getting a string ends with a dot typed by the user and start to
find out number of the words, letters and vowel letters through the next steps:

* naming variables and giving the siutable types for each one
* ask the user to enter a string
* create a for loop with condition of being no character stored in the given z index memory equals to '.' and the counter of the z index always less than the length of the string
* inside the loop check with if selector that the character stored in the choosen z index is not equal ' '
* if yes then increment the nuber of characters
* in addition to checking with if selector if this character from vowels or not
* if yes increment the number of vowels
* but if in the begining the character inside the string was equal to ' ' then increment the number of spaces
* in addition to chcking with an if selector if the user has mistaken by typing a space in the begaining of the string or typed more than space beside each other,
    then the code will continue as it is considered as a mistake from the user
* calculating the nnumber of the spaces after the end of the for loop will make it easily to calculate the number of the words by adding one to the number of spaces
* at the end order the compiler to show the user the number of words, characters and vowels
